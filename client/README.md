# Client

## What is this?
This folder contains the client built to work with the server. This client has been built using React Native (the Expo toolkit to be more specific) and boasts persistant data storage thanks to React Redux. To build this yourself, install the expo toolkit by following the instructions on https://expo.io and then run `expo build` in this directory.
